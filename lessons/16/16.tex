\subsection{Measurements of \( Z^{0} \) mass}
%https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-electron-positron-collider
One of the most successful measurement of the \( Z^0 \) boson mass was performed at LEP (Large Electron-Positron) collider. It was built at CERN and its structure is showed in Figure \ref{fig:L16_LEPC}.

The tunnel is 27 kilometers long and it has four interaction points: ALEPH, OPAL, DELPHI and L3. When the LEP collider started operation in August 1989 it accelerated the electrons and positrons to a total energy of \( 45 \ \si{GeV} \) each to enable production of the \( Z \) boson, which has a mass of \( 91 \ \si{GeV} \). The accelerator was upgraded later to enable production of a pair of \( W \) bosons, each having a mass of \( 80 \ \si{GeV} \). LEP collider energy eventually topped at \( 209 \ \si{GeV} \) at the end in 2000. At a Lorentz factor of over 200,000 (given by the particle energy divided by rest mass, so \( 104.5 \ \si{GeV} / 0.511 \ \si{MeV} \)), LEP still holds the particle accelerator speed record, extremely close to the limiting speed of light. At the end of 2000, LEP was shut down and then dismantled in order to make room in the tunnel for the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

LEP was fed with electrons and positrons delivered by CERN's accelerator complex. The particles were generated and initially accelerated by the LEP Pre-Injector, and further accelerated to nearly the speed of light by the Proton Synchrotron and the Super Proton Synchrotron. From there, they were injected into the LEP ring.
As in all ring colliders, the LEP's ring consisted of many magnets which forced the charged particles into a circular trajectory (so that they stay inside the ring), RF accelerators which accelerated the particles with radio frequency waves, and quadrupoles that focussed the particle beam (i.e. keep the particles together). The function of the accelerators was to increase the particles' energies so that heavy particles can be created when the particles collide. When the particles were accelerated to maximum energy (and focused to bunches), an electron and a positron bunch were made to collide with each other at one of the collision points of the detector. When an electron and a positron collide, they annihilate to a virtual particle, either a photon or a \( Z \) boson. The virtual particle almost immediately decays into other elementary particles (fermion and antifermion), which are then detected by the four huge particle detectors.

Let's see now one of the most important measurements done by LEP: the \( Z^0 \) line shape. The method employed consists in scanning the \( e^+e^- \) cross section in steps of energy. This can be achieved by preparing \( e^- \) and \( e^+ \) at a precise energy such that the energy in the center of  mass \( \sqrt{s} \) is equal to the value of the step under study. By doing sevaral experiments in which the energy is increased, we get the cross section dependence on \( \sqrt{s} \). What can be observed in its plot is a resonance at around \( 91 \ \si{GeV} \), modeled by a Breit-Wigner:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma
	\sim
	\abs{\frac{1}{s - m^2_Z + i m_Z \Gamma_Z}}
	\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
where \( \Gamma_Z \) is the width of the shape. The energy resolution of LEP \( \Delta E_{\mathrm{LEP}} \) is much smaller that \( \Gamma_Z \), for this reason the Breit-Wigner shape is clearly visible in experimental data. The result is showed in Figure \ref{fig:L16_LEPZLS}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\figpath{16}/16_images/LEPZLS.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:L16_LEPZLS} Cross section dependence on \( \sqrt{s} \) and resonance.}
\end{figure}

Before extracting from the fit the width \( \Gamma_Z \), we have to be sure that the cross section prediction (i.e. the fit model) should take into account radiative corrections (photons attached to the external legs of \( e^- \) and \( e^+ \) in the Feynman diagrams). The Initial State Radiation (ISR) causes a reduction in the height of the peak in the cross section for \( \sqrt{s} \le 91 \ \si{GeV} \). For \( \sqrt{s} > 91 \ \si{GeV} \), ISR increases the height of the peak.

The experimental results of LEP and other experiments for \( Z^0 \) mass measurement are given in Figure \ref{fig:L16_Z0MER}. The most precise measurement up to now is:
\begin{equation}
	M_Z
	=
	91.1876 \pm 0.0021 \ \si{GeV}
	\label{eq:}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{\figpath{16}/16_images/Z0MER.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:L16_Z0MER} Experimental data on \( e^+e^- \rightarrow \text{hadrons} \) cross section from several experiments.}
\end{figure}

The second thing that we can measure is the number of neutrino families. The width of the \( Z \) has several contributions:
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma_Z
	=
	\Gamma_{ee} + \Gamma_{\mu\mu} + \Gamma_{\tau\tau} + \Gamma_{\mathrm{had}} + \Gamma_{\mathrm{inv}}
	=
	\Gamma_{\ell\ell} + \Gamma_{\mathrm{had}} + \Gamma_{\mathrm{inv}}
	\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
Concerning the first three pieces, we can write them in a unique \( \Gamma_{\ell\ell} \) since it is experimentally proved by measuring the branching ratio that the contribution for every type of lepton is the same. \( \Gamma_{\mathrm{inv}} \) can be written as the number of neutring families multiplied by every \( \Gamma_{\mathrm{inv},i} \) if the only invisibles are the neutrinos. By fitting the cross section with the number of neutrino families as a free parameter, we get a result like the one in Figure \ref{fig:L16_Z0NFN}.

	\caption{\label{fig:L16_Z0NFN} Shape of the \( Z \) boson cross section curve with respect to the number of neutrino families and fit with experimental data.}
\end{figure}

The result of this procedure is that the number of neutrino families is:
\begin{equation}
	N_{\nu}
	=
	2.9840 \pm 0.0082
	\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
