\section{Hadron production: \( e^+e^- \rightarrow hh \)}
With this well-understood QED process as a reference point, we can now discuss the process of \( e^+e^- \) annihilation to hadrons. The main products of this reaction are observed to be \( \pi \) and \( K \) mesons. We will consider the ultrarelativistic regime, so we will consider this process at multi-GeV center of mass energies.

Hadrons are formed by quarks. Imagine that we are at center of mass energies at which we can ignore the quark masses. Then, since quarks are spin-\( \frac{1}{2} \) particles, the structure of the QED cross section for quark pair production is exactly the same as that in the process of muon pair production that we have just analyzed. By stopping here, we are ignoring the effects of the strong interaction, which play an essential role in forming the mesons that appear in the final state. However, perhaps this model would be useful as an estimate of the order of magnitude of the cross section or as a reference value.

The changes in the calculations are the following three corrections:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First, \( \sigma \) depends on \( E_\mathrm{CM} \), so we must sum over the relevant quark species produced at the given energy. Remember that we can ignore the masses at the energy we consider with a good approximation.
	\item Second, we need to change the	value of the electric charge of the produced particles, from \( -1 \) for the muon to \( Q_f = + \frac{2}{3} \) for \( u \), \( c \), and \( Q_f = - \frac{1}{3} \) for \( d \), \( s \), \( b \). The matrix element \( \mathcal{M} \) contains one power of the final electric charge, so the cross section is proportional to \( Q^2_f \).
	\item Finally, quarks carry a hidden quantum number called color, which can take three values. We need to sum over the final color states in computing the total cross section.
\end{itemize}
Thus, these corrections lead to the same angular distribution as before for the muon pair production:
\begin{equation}
	\dv{\sigma}{\cos \theta} (e^+e^- \longrightarrow hh)
	\sim
	\qty(1 + \cos^2 \theta)
	\label{eq:L07_HPDCS}
\end{equation}
while the total cross section is modified to:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma(e^+e^- \longrightarrow hh)
	=
	\sum_{f} 3 Q_f^2 \frac{4\pi}{3} \frac{\alpha^2}{E^2_\mathrm{CM}}
	\qquad
	f = u, d, s, c, b
	\label{eq:L07_HPCS}
\end{equation}
Note that the quark top \( t \) is not included in the sum since its mass is very large and the approximation made before doesn't hold if we include it.

Another quantity that we can analyze is the ratio:
\begin{equation}
	R
	=
	\frac{\sigma(e^+e^- \longrightarrow hh)}{\sigma(e^+e^- \longrightarrow \mu^+\mu^-)}
	=
	\sum_{f} 3 Q^2_f
	=
	\begin{cases}
		2	&	u,d,s	\\
		3 \frac{1}{3}	&	u,d,s,c	\\
		3 \frac{2}{3}	&	u,d,s,c,b
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:L07_HPR}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

The prediction for the angular distributions can also be tested experimentally. Before considering any method of detailed comparison, we need to ask what \( e^+e^- \longrightarrow hh \) events actually look like at high energies. Figure \ref{fig:L07_SLDE} shows a typical event at \( E_\mathrm{CM} = 91 \ \si{GeV} \). The tracks are mostly charged pions and kaons. The tracks clearly form two bundles, with \( \pi \) and \( K \) mesons moving in opposite directions. We call such a bundle of hadronic tracks a \textbf{jet}. The final states of \( e^+e^- \) annihilation to hadrons at high energy typically consist of two back-to-back jets.

\chapter{Deep Inelastic Electron Scattering}
The discovery that quarks can be described by spin-\( \frac{1}{2} \) particles with simple electromagnetic interactions was actually made, not with this process, but in an earlier experiment studying a reaction in which this conclusion was even more surprising. It is the scattering \( ep \longrightarrow ep \).

As electron scattering is observed with larger transfers of momentum to the proton, elastic collisions become infrequent. Most scattering events break the proton open and produce a large number of hadrons. When the total mass of the hadrons is much larger than the original proton mass, the reaction is refered to as deep inelastic electron-proton scattering. Now we will see that this regime is well described using a picture in which electrons scatter from free quarks inside the proton. What is surprising is that we can ignore the strong interaction ti a first approximation in the scattering of the electrons from quarks inside protons.





\section{The SLAC-MIT experiment}
Deep inelastic scattering was first studied in the 1960's at the SLAC linear electron accelerator. The purpose of the experiment was to study the structure of the proton through elestic scattering at high energies. The process can be schematized as follow:
\begin{equation}
	e^-p
	\longrightarrow
	e^-X
	\label{eq:L07_DISEP}
\end{equation}
where \( X \) can be anything. The electron in the final state goes through a spectrometer in order to recontruct its 4-momentum. The hadronic final state was ignored.

A Feynamn diagram of this process is given in Figure \ref{fig:L07_EPDISFD}:
%TODO add Feynamn diagram (p.125 [1])

The electron interacts with a current matrix element:
\begin{equation}
	\bra{e^-(k')} j^\mu \ket{e^-(k)}
	\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
The current couples to a virtual photon, which then couples to another current acting on the proton. The mass \( W \) of the final hadronic system is given by:
\begin{equation}
	W^2
	=
	(P+q)^2
	=
	m^2_p + 2P \cdot q + q^2
	\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
Remember that the energy transfer is much larger than the mass of the proton, so we can ignore both the electron and proton mass. \( q \) is spacelike, so there exists a frame where the energy transfer is zero and only momentum is transfered. The cross sections as a function of \( W \) for increasing values of \( Q^2 = - q^2 \) are showed in Figure \ref{fig:L07_CSDIS}
%TODO add cross section plot





\section{The parton model}
To understand the meaning of deep inelastic scattering observed data, Feynamn proposed a simple picture based on free quarks and antiquarks that he called \textbf{parton model}. Feynamn modeled the proton as a collection of costituents called \textbf{partons}. Some of these might be quarks, which we already expect as costituents of the proton. At very high energy, all partons are moving approximately in the direction of the proton, so all partons have a large component of momentum along the direction of the proton, while their transverse momenta remain of the order of the momenta within the proton bound state. So the momentum vector of a parton can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	p^\mu
	=
	\xi P^\mu
	\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
where \( P \) is the total energy momentum of the proton and \( \xi \) is the fraction of this energy-momentum carried by that parton. \( \xi \) runs over the values 0 and 1.

Let \( f_i(\xi)\d{\xi} \) be the probability of finding a parton of type \( i \) carrying the momentum fraction \( \xi \). The whole set of partons carry the total energy-momentum of the proton. This implies the sum rule:
\begin{equation}
	\int_{0}^{1} \d{\xi} \sum_{i} f_i(\xi) \cdot \xi
	=
	1
	\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
%TODO Feynman diagram in parton model

The parton model cross section reads:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma(e^-p \rightarrow e^-X)
	=
	\int \d{\xi} \sum_{f} \qty[f_f(\xi) + f_\bar{f}(\xi)] \sigma(e^-q(\xi p) \rightarrow e^-q)
	\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
