\section{Recap: interaction of particles with matter}
The way we identify particles is through their interaction with matter. So, we can detect:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Charged particles based on ionization, breamsstrahlung, Cherenkov effect.
    \item \( \gamma \)-rays based on photoelectric/Compton effect and pair production.
    \item Neutrons based on strong interaction.
    \item Neutrinos based on weak interaction.
\end{itemize}
We will give only a phenomenological treatment since the goal is to be able to understand the implications for detector design.

\subsection{Interactions involving the electrons and heavier particles}
\marginpar{Interaction through ionization}
A relativistic charged particle with a mass much greater that the mass of the electron, when passing through the matter, is subject to a loss of energy due to the interaction with atomic electrons. These ones can be substracted from the atom and then can be detected. From the total charge collected by the electrodes of a detector, it is possible to know the original interacting particle. The equation that describes this interaction and the loss of energy is the \textbf{Bethe-Bloch Equation} (in natural units):
\begin{equation}
    - \left\langle \dv{E}{x} \right\rangle
    =
    K \rho \frac{Z}{A} \frac{z^2}{\beta^2}
    \qty[ \frac{1}{2} \log \frac{2 m_e c^2 \beta^2 \gamma^2 T_\mathrm{max}}{I^2} - \beta^2 - \frac{\delta(\beta \gamma)}{2} - \frac{C}{z} ]
    \label{eq:L04_BBF}
\end{equation}
where the meaning of the various symbols is given in Table \ref{tab:L04_BBFS}. A plot showing the stopping power in function of the factor \( \beta \gamma \) is given in Figure \ref{fig:L04_BBFP}. In particular, from this plot we can see some interesting characteristics of the energy loss process. In the first part, the particle loses more energy when the its velocity is slower, so the trend is \( \sim \frac{1}{\beta^2} \). When the energy increases, a minimum is met, whose \( x \)-axis value is approximately the same for every material. The right part of the plot with respect to this minimum shows a gain in the energy loss which is due to relativistic effects.

\medskip
\marginpar{Breamsstrahlung energy loss}
The Bethe-Bloch formula is valid for particles much heavier than the electron. For this kind of particles, we have that relativistic effects even at low energies, since its mass is lower in comparison with the other particles. So, the electron loses energy through ionization (at lower energies) and \textbf{breamsstrahlung}, namely \textit{braking radiation}, when deflected by another charged particle (at higher energies). The different materials that the electron can pass through, are characterized by their \textbf{radiation length} \( X_0 \), which is a quantity empirically defined as the distance covered by an electron beam before its energy decreases by a factor \( \frac{1}{e} \) (63\%.). It is measured in \( \si{g/cm^2} \) and an approximation of its expression is:
\begin{equation}
    X_0
    =
    \frac{A}{4 \alpha N_A Z^2 r^2_e \log \frac{183}{Z^{\frac{1}{3}}}}
    \label{eq:L04_RLA}
\end{equation}
Moreover, there exists a point in which the loss of energy due to ionization and the loss of eergy due to breamsstrahlung are equal. This point is called\textbf{critical energy} \( E_\mathrm{c} \) and a relatively good approximation of its value is:
\begin{equation}
    E_\mathrm{c}
    \approx
    \frac{600 \ \si{MeV}}{Z}
    \label{eq:L04_CEA}
\end{equation}

\marginpar{Energy loss as a function of other parameters}
Concerning the trend of these losses, we find that the ionization loss decreases logarithmically with \( E \) and increases linearly with \( Z \), while bremsstrahlung loss increases approximately linearly with \( E \) and it is the dominant process at high energies.

\subsection{Interaction of photon with the matter}
Photons can lose energy in several ways. The possibilities are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Photoelectric effect on atoms at low energy.
    \item Compton effect, which is important at medium range energies.
    \item Pair production, which is the dominant process at higher energies.
\end{itemize}
It goes without saying that we will focus on pair production, since we are discussing topics whose energies are relatively high. Concerning the cross section of this process, it is approximated by:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_\mathrm{pair}
    =
    \frac{7}{9} \frac{N_A}{A} \frac{1}{X_0}
    \label{eq:L04_PPCS}
\end{equation}
%TODO add plots

We can characterize a certain material by defining the \textbf{attenuation length} \( \lambda \), namely the length for which the beam of photons inside the material is attenuated by a factor \( \frac{1}{e} \), and it is linked to the radiation length by \( \lambda = \frac{9}{7} X_0 \).





\section{Gaseous, scintillator and solid state detectors}

\subsection{Ionization in gas detectors}
Primary ionization:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Particle} + X \longrightarrow X^+ + e^- + \text{Particle}
    \label{eq:}
\end{equation}
Secondary ionization:
\begin{equation}
    X + e^- \longrightarrow X^+ + e^- + e^-
    \label{eq:}
\end{equation}
The relevant parameters to evaluate the number of particles produced are the ionization energy \( E_i \), the average energy/ion pair \( W_i \) and the average number of ion pairs (per cm) \( n_T \).  In particular:
\begin{equation}
    \left\langle n_T \right\rangle
    =
    \frac{L \left\langle \dv{E}{x} \right\rangle}{W_i}
    \label{eq:}
\end{equation}
with \( L \) the thickness of the material. Typical values for \( E_i \) are
%TODO

Concerning the diffusion, it is significantly modified by the presence of a magnetic field, with transverse and longitudinal orientation depending on it. By measuring the bending of the particle, we are able to infer the momentum of the particle itself. The electric field influences only the longitudinal diffusion and not the transverse diffusion.

The electrons can undergo to a multiplication process called townsend avalanche. Given the number of electrons at the position \( x \), \( n(x) = n_0 e^{\alpha x} \), we have the gain:
\begin{equation}
    G
    =
    \frac{n(x)}{n_0}
    =
    e^{\alpha x}
    \label{eq:}
\end{equation}
where \( \alpha \) can depend on x.

There are four regions of work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geiger-Muller coun
    %TODO
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Multiwire proportional chambers}
Signal generations: electron drift to closest wire, gas amplification near wire that creates avalanche
%TODO



\subsection{Drift chambers}
In this case we can have two dimensional informations through time measurments, namely drift time measurement. It starts by an external detector such as a scintillator counter. Electrons drift to the anode in the field created by anode and cathode. The electron arrival at the anode stops in the time measurement.
\begin{equation}
    x
    =
    \int_{0}^{t_D} v_D \d{t}
    \label{eq:}
\end{equation}
We build the detector with a known drift velocity. We can introduce field wires
%TODO



\subsection{Semiconductor detectors}
Semiconductor detectors have the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item High density (respect to gas detectors), so large energy loss in a short distance
    \item A small diffusion effect, so position resolution of less than \( 10 \ \si{\mu m} \)
    \item Low ionization energy, so it is easier to produce particles.
\end{itemize}

The materials employed for their construction are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Germanium, which needs to be operated at a very low temperature (\( 77 \ \si{K} \)) due to small band gap.
    \item Silicon, which can operate at room temperature.
    \item Diamond, resistent to very hard radiations, low signal and high cost.
\end{itemize}

Silicon detectors are based on a p-n junction with reverse bias applied to enlarge the depletion region. The potential barrier becomes higher so that the diffusion across the junction is suppressed and the current across the junction is very small (``leakage current'').
%TODO add images

Such a detector can be built in strips. By segmenting the implant we can reconstruct the position of hte transversing particle in one dimension. We have a higher field close to the collecting electrodes where most of the signal is induced. Strips can be read with dedicated electronics to minimize the noise. To have 2-dimensional measurements, double sided silicon detector are used. A type of silicon detector still in development is the pixel detector (for 3-dimensional measurements).

Noise contributions can be leakage current and electronics readout.

Position resolution is the spread of the reconstructed position minus the true position. For example:
\begin{align}
    \sigma &= \frac{\text{pitch}}{\sqrt{12}}       & \text{One strip cluster}&&&& \\
    \sigma &= \frac{\text{pitch}}{1.5 \frac{S}{N}} & \text{Two strip cluster}&&&&
\end{align}





\section{Track reconstruction}
Track reconstruction is used to determine momentum of charged particles by measuring the bending of a particle trajectory in a magnetic field
